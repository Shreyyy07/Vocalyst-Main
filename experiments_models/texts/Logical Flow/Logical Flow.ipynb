Born in 1841 in Canada (she later moved to Michigan), Sarah chafed from the lack of career opportunities available to young women in the mid-nineteenth century. Her choices ranged from low-paying menial jobs to the profession of last resort: prostitution. Sarah, therefore, reasoned that because good jobs went to men, she would become one; she cut her hair short, put on men’s clothing and adopted the name Franklin Thompson. Although delicate looking, Sarah acted convincingly enough as a male not only to pass as one but also to successfully gain jobs available to men. She became a book salesman and made a substantial amount of money excelling at this occupation. Because of this success, Sarah had to be extremely careful not to let her guard down and reveal who she really was.\"\n",

First, I would analyze each component to understand its role and how it fits into the overall problem. After identifying key areas that need focus, I would prioritize them based on their impact and dependencies. Next, I would research and gather necessary information for each part and devise solutions using structured methods such as design thinking or systems thinking. Throughout the process, I would regularly test and iterate, ensuring each part is working efficiently before integrating everything into a final solution. Collaboration and communication with relevant stakeholders would be key to ensure alignment and identify any potential roadblocks early on.\"]\n",

Instead, I’d just dive in and start solving everything simultaneously, hoping that it would all magically come together. If something goes wrong, I would ignore it and keep going, because stopping would be a waste of time. As for working with others, I don’t think it’s necessary; it’s faster if I just do everything myself. Eventually, the problem will solve itself, and if it doesn’t, I’ll try again next time, but quicker.\"]\n",
