## üìù **Introduction**

Communication isn't just about words; it's about tone, emotion, pacing, expressions, and structure. Current tools like ChatGPT or YouTube tutorials focus only on text, missing out on how you sound or look. **Voclayst** fills this gap by providing a unified solution that gives real-time, multimodal feedback‚Äîcovering voice, face, and text. It helps users improve public speaking and presentation skills by capturing video inputs and analyzing speech delivery, facial expressions, and content structure.
